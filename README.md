1️⃣ **What is user.js?**

user.js is a configuration file for Firefox that automatically applies complex settings every time the browser is launched. It's a fully-fledged tool for that allows you to hide your digital footprints and control browser behavior at a deep level.

2️⃣ **My user.js purpose:**

- Maximum anonymity and privacy: protection from tracking, analytics, and fingerprinting.
- Browser behavior control: fine-tuning WebRTC, WebAudio, WebGL, and device APIs.
- Data storage control: automatic clearing of all critical data upon closing.
- Network and speed management: optimization of caching, parallel connections, and processes for stable and fast performance.
- Exclusion of telemetry and unwanted experiments: complete control over data sent to Mozilla servers.

My user.js is designed to blend in as much as possible with most other identical Firefox users. One of the main rules of anonymity is not only to protect yourself as much as possible, but also to avoid attracting unnecessary attention.

3️⃣ **Key Features:**

1. Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) and bounce-tracking protection
2. First-party isolation for separating website contexts
3. Complete disabling of potentially dangerous APIs (WebRTC, microphone, camera, telemetry, gamepads, telephony)
4. Control over all aspects of caching and history
5. Standardization of fonts, language, and time zone to minimize fingerprint uniqueness
6. Network speed and behavior settings: maximum combination of anonymity and performance

4️⃣ **Installation:**

1. In the search bar, enter *about:profiles*
2. Create a new Firefox profile.
3. Place user.js in the root directory of the profile.
4. Start Firefox from it — all settings will be applied automatically.

5️⃣ **Warnings:**

I checked the profile and did not find any unexpected errors. However, there is still a small chance that some sites may not work correctly (media, geolocation, logins,).

**Contributing:** Fork, test, if you found an error or have a suggestion for improvement - suggest on GitHub.
